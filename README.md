## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I didn't want to work with
fixed values since I was aiming for responsiveness and
flexibility. This means moving of **px** to **rem**:

```css
#card_wrapper {
	padding: 1rem;
}
```

And also using using the **min()** function in CSS to apply
the smaller value to the elements width:

```css
#card_wrapper {
	width: min(20rem, 90vw);
}
```

### Continued development

I still believe I have a lot of brushing up to do regarding
certain areas and topics in frontend development especially
with:

-   HTML Markdown structuring
-   Layouts
-   Transitions
-   Animations
-   Responsiveness
-   And some modern CSS features and conventions for optimal
    page performance.
